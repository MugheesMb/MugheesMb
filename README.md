#### Hola ! I'm Mughees, Senior Web Developer who loves to solve real-world problemsðŸ˜€ ,I love adventures & taking risks so every second I search for a new thing to do which  will  help me open up for new opportunities as well as teach me new ideas about life. I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who takes the time to  continue learning and keep improving myself. I take responsibility for my actions and when things go wrong I donâ€™t look to outside forces to blame, rather Iâ€™m someone   who looks at where I can improve upon the next time around. Pointing fingers solves nothing ðŸ˜… . I am committed to building something larger, and someone who puts aside  personal gain for the well-being of the group. besides that, I also love to contribute to open source ;) In the end, I am on a journey to never stop learning âœ” <h6>
